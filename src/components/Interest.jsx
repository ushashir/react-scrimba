            <p>
                I have build several Single Page Applications (SPA) using Model View Controller framework (MVC). I have also worked with REST API's and can comfortably manipulate JSON files. I have also worked remotely on several projects with other developers using Git and Github as our major collaborative tool.
                If it will solve a problem, I want to be part of it. Just send a message.
            </p>

        </div>
    );
}

export default Interest;
